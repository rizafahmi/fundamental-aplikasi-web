                <p class="note__body">Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one. I was basically alone. I didn't have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs of money, building amazing teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a "measly" lifestyle business. It wasn't what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.</p>

                <h2 class="note__title">New beginnings</h2>
                <p class="note__body">Then one day, everything changed. Again. I'm wary about sharing this part of the story, because I don't know if there is anything to learn from it. But it happened, so here it is. One investor joined them. We've bought back a couple more, since then. I keep the rest of the investors up-to-date with a brief email every few months.
                The future came into focus: I could grow a small team, slowly buy back our investors, and build Gumroad into a meaningful business focused on our creators. We would never become a billion-dollar company, and that started to feel okay. Certainly, the thousands of creators selling on Gumroad wouldn't mind.</p>
